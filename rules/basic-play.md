# Basic Play

## Setup

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Players | 2–5 |
| Hand size | 5 cards (default) or 7 |
| First turn | Player left of dealer |
| Deck | Standard 52 cards, no Jokers |

1. Shuffle and deal cards to each player
2. Place remaining cards face-down as the **draw pile**
3. Flip the top card to start the **discard pile**

---

## Turn Flow

On your turn, choose **one**:

### ▶️ Play
Place a card on the discard pile that matches by **suit** or **rank**.

> **Example:** If the top card is 7♥, you can play any ♥ or any 7.

### ▶️ Draw
Take one card from the draw pile. Your turn ends.

## Matching Rules

| Top Card | You Can Play |
|----------|--------------|
| 7♥ | Any ♥ (suit match) |
| 7♥ | Any 7 (rank match) |
| Q♦ | **Any card!** (Queen = free start) |

---

## Queen Exception

When a **Queen** is on top of the discard pile:
- You may play **any card** (no matching required)
- You **must** play immediately — you can't skip covering a Queen

## Deck Runs Out?

If the draw pile is empty:
1. Take all cards from the discard pile except the top card
2. Shuffle them to form a new draw pile
3. Continue playing
