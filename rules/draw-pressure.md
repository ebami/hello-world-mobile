# Draw Pressure & Shields

When someone plays a **2** or **Black Jack**, the next player is under **draw pressure**.

---

## What is Draw Pressure?

You're under draw pressure when facing an accumulated draw penalty that you must respond to.

---

## Your Options

When under draw pressure, you have **three choices**:

### 1. Stack 🃏
Play another **2** or **Black Jack** to increase the total and pass it on.

> **Example:** Facing +2? Play a 2 to make it +4 for the next player.

💡 **Stacking ignores normal matching** — you can play any 2 or Black Jack regardless of suit.

---

### 2. Shield 🛡️
Play a **Red Jack (J♥ or J♦)** to cancel the **entire** accumulated draw.

⚠️ **Your turn ends immediately** after playing a Red Jack.

---

### 3. Draw 📥
If you can't or won't stack/shield, **draw the full total**.

Your turn ends after drawing.

## Important Notes

- You must **stack, shield, or draw first**
- Draw totals **add up**: 2+2+Black Jack = +9 cards
