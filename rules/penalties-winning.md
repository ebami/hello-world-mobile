# Penalties & Winning

## Penalties

When a rule is broken, apply the penalty **immediately**.

---

### Mistake — Draw 2, Turn Ends

Any illegal action results in drawing 2 cards. Your turn ends and the illegal card is taken back.

**Examples of mistakes:**
- Playing out of turn
- Illegal match (wrong suit/rank)
- Starting a run while under draw pressure
- Using Queen after wrong card (not J/K of same suit)
- Continuing to play after a Red Jack
- Wrapping Ace twice in one run
- Changing direction mid-run

---

### Exposure — Draw 1, Turn Continues

Revealing hidden information (like showing your cards) costs 1 card, but your turn continues.

> If you're under draw pressure, you still have to deal with that too.

---

### Queen Not Covered — Draw 1, Turn Ends

If you play a Queen in a run and don't cover it:
- Draw 1 card
- Your turn ends
- Queen stays on top (next player gets free start)

## Quick Reference

| Infraction | Penalty | Turn Ends? |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Mistake (illegal action) | Draw 2 | ✅ Yes |
| Exposure (revealed info) | Draw 1 | ❌ No |
| Queen not covered | Draw 1 | ✅ Yes |
| Last card not declared | Draw 1 | — |

---

## Last Card Declaration

When you're down to **one card**, you must announce it:

> "Last card!" or "Uno!" (or whatever you agree on)

**If you forget** and go out without declaring:
- Draw 1 card as penalty
- You're back in the game

---

## Winning the Game

You win when:
1. You have **no cards left**, AND
2. You **declared** when you had one card

🎉 **Congratulations — you've won!**
