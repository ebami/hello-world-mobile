# How to Play — Quick Start

## Goal
Be the first to **get rid of all your cards**.

---

## Setup
- **2–5 players**
- Deal **5 cards** each (or 7 for longer games)
- Flip one card to start the **discard pile**

---

## On Your Turn

**Option 1: Play a card**  
Your card must match the top of the discard pile by:
- **Same suit** (e.g., ♥ on ♥), OR
- **Same rank** (e.g., 7 on 7)

**Option 2: Draw**  
If you can't (or don't want to) play, draw one card from the deck.

## Winning
When you play your **last card**, you win!  
⚠️ You must say **"Last card!"** when you're down to one.
