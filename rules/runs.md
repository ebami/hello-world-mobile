# Runs

A **run** is when you play multiple cards in sequence on a single turn.

---

## Basic Run Rules

1. **First card** must still match the discard (suit or rank)
2. Move **±1 rank** per step (e.g., 9→10→J)
3. Stay in the **same suit** for ±1 steps
4. Pick a direction and **stick with it** (no reversing mid-run)

> ✅ **Valid:** 7♣ → 8♣ → 9♣ → 10♣

---

## Changing Suit (Same-Rank Hop)

To switch suits, play **one or more cards of the same rank**:

> ✅ **Valid:** 6♣ → 6♦ → 6♥ → 7♥

After hopping, continue ±1 in the new suit.

---

## Ace Wrap

The **Ace bridges King and 2** — but only **once per run**.

> ✅ **Valid:** Q♠ → K♠ → A♠ → 2♠ → 3♠

> ❌ **Invalid:** …K→A→2→3→ **A** →… (second wrap)

## Queen in Runs (Pivot Rule)

Queen can only appear in a run **immediately after J or K of the same suit**.

After playing a Queen, you must either:
- **Cover it** with any card (then continue the run), OR
- **Don't cover** → Draw 1, turn ends, Queen stays on top

### Examples

> ✅ **Valid pivot:** J♠ → Q♠ → 10♦ → 9♦

> ❌ **Invalid:** J♣ → Q♥ (wrong suit)

> ✅ **Pivot with hops:** J♥ → Q♥ → 6♣ → 6♦ → 6♥ → 7♥
