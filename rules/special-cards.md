# Special Cards

Some cards have special effects when played. The effect applies based on the **last card** you play on your turn.

---

## 2 — Draw Two
Next player must **draw 2 cards**.

💡 Can be stacked! If they have a 2, they can add it and pass +4 to the next player.

---

## Black Jack (J♠ / J♣) — Draw Five
Next player must **draw 5 cards**.

💡 Stacks with 2s and other Black Jacks.

---

## Red Jack (J♥ / J♦) — Shield
**Cancels all accumulated draw** when played against a 2 or Black Jack.

⚠️ Playing a Red Jack **ends your turn** immediately.

---

## 8 — Skip
**Skip** the next player's turn.

---

## King — Reverse
**Reverse** the direction of play.

> In a 2-player game, this acts like a skip.

---

## Ace — Change Suit
The **suit of the Ace** becomes the new active suit for matching.

> Example: Play A♠ to change the required suit to ♠.

---

## Queen — Free Start / Pivot

**When on top of discard:**
- Next player can play **any card** (free start)
- Queen **must be covered** — you can't skip it

**In runs:**
- Can only follow a **J or K of the same suit**
- Must be covered immediately or draw 1
